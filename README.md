## 🔒 Focus: RFID & NFC Microchips

I'm exploring how subdermal and external RFID/NFC technologies can improve authentication, secure access, and identity verification.

**Current Projects Include:**
- Human implants for digital ID & crypto wallets  
- RFID-based smart entry systems  
- Secure NFC workflows for contactless login  
- Research into privacy, encryption, and safety of embedded tech

These projects aren’t just ideas — they’re hands-on, self-tested systems built to explore the boundaries of modern security and interface design.
